        <h4> Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean? </h4>
        <p>Responsive design is a GUI based design approach which helps in creating the webpage. It allows the webpage to have flexible layout, images and CSS media queries. The main objective of the responsive web design is to identify the user screen size and adjust the webpage layout accordingly.  </p>

        <h4> How does responsive design relate to web technologies? </h4>
        <p>The responsive design includes three core principles. These are Fluid Grid System, Fluid Image Use and Media quires. Here, the Fluid Grid system refers to the  page layout in which all the elements occupy the same percentage of space irrespective of the user screen size. The fluid Image use refers to the images size. The fluid image user helps in adjusting the image size as per user screen size. And media queries are filters used to detect the browsing device’s dimension and make the design look clear. It can also alter the webpage layout to meet the specific conditions. </p>

        <h4> What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research? </h4>
        <p> Web apps are the application that is accessed through web browser like chrome or Firefox with the use of internet. Web apps generally loads in web browser and does not take any physical memory to load on the user device. Web apps are considered to be the future. This is because it does not require any installation. Web apps attracts the users through better content in different types of device sizes. Efficacy if the features varies if different devices as context of usage are different. Smartphones are used as alternatives to desktop applications. Thus, it is essential to design a web app that focuses on core function and activities that user may like. For example, the Google’s mobile website provides different items in navigation as compared to desktop website. The web app has interaction and functionality in an effective manner for different devices. The developers must have knowledge about the strength and weakness of each device so that the web app can be developed accordingly. With the emergence of cloud computing such as AWS, web apps are now evolving as cloud apps. </p>

        <h4> Finally, describe your learning experience in the course </h4>
        <p> In the course, I learned about the HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I think these three are the main components to create an effective website. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a set of symbols or codes that are used in file to create a website that can be displayed over internet. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to format layout of the web page. It is mainly used to define the text style, table, classes and others aspect of the webpage. Java Script is used to enhance the HTML page. JavaScript is an interpreted language and thus does not need to be compiled. </p>
        <p> In this course I also learned about the ways to create a website. Such a creating a sign-up page. In which different tags were used. Such as label tag, select tag, div tag, and many more. This course also teched me to link different web pages, adding style sheet and JS file to the HTML page.  </p>
